# 180mm3-Printer-Name-TBD
Files and design for my 180mm^3 printer

Few design ideas right now


Motherboard - BTT V1.4 w/ MOTv1.0 for a total of 8 stepper motors, or BTT Pro V1.2 for 6


Power Supply - ??? At least 200W, no bigger than 350W


Heated Bed: Prusa Mini DC Magnetic Bed w/PEI Sheets


Stepper Motors - Stealing from whatever the V0.2 uses, changing around the Z motor


Nozzle - Unknown right now, probably will do something with quick swap. I probably want a CHT nozzle to go super fast


Extruder - Going to steal/modify a current extruder design, direct drive


Display: Will probably get octoprint set up, but also hoping for a nice touchscreen


Firmware: I will get a custom klipper profile set up


Auto Leveling: I will have autoleveling, just unsure as to how. 


Core XY machine, have not decided whether to do belted z or leadscrew z yet.


Enclosed, hoping to reach chamber temps of ~60C at least, Nozzle of at least 300C, maybe even 350C


Above all, this should be fast. And relatively cheap and easy to make.
