# What Is Bismuth?
Bismuth is my custom designed 3D printer that I designed _from scratch_ to fufill my dream of having a printer small enough to fit on my table, fast enough to print parts quickly, and good enough to print all sorts of materials. My goal was to push this printer as fast as humanly possible. THis project is the culmination of over 100 hours of CAD, 20 hours of research, and many hours to come of building and firmware. As of this point, Bismuth is _just a cad design_. I am currently working on sourcing all of the parts to build this, after which I will work on firmware and tuning. 

Before I get into the specifications of the machine, you can find the full CAD design in [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ea3003fedda180a5827edece/w/24975c8a2f1006566d68c26a/e/f749387482ee518d7d44cc61).

### Why Call It Bismuth?

Bismuth is a chemical element with atomic number 83. Wheh crystalized, it makes really awesome square-like crystal shapes, like the shape of this printer. Additionally, bismuth comes in all sorts of shapes and colors. When combined with other materials, it is used as electrical fuses and more! All of these factors combined makes the name Bismuth a perfect name for this printer!
