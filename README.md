# 180mm3-Printer-Name-TBD
Files and design for my 180mm^3 printer

Few design ideas right now


Motherboard - BTT V1.4 w/ MOTv1.0 for a total of 8 stepper motors


Power Supply - MeanWell 24V 350W Power Supply 


Heated Bed: Prusa Mini DC Magnetic Bed w/PEI Sheets


Stepper Motors - 


Nozzle - Hardened CHT Nozzle with standard M6 Threads. 


Extruder - Sherpa Mini


Display: Will get octoprint set up, but also hoping for a nice touchscreen


Firmware: I will get a custom klipper profile set up


Auto Leveling: I will have autoleveling, just unsure as to how. 


Core XY machine, 3 Motor Leadscrew with kinematic joints to have tramming


Enclosed, hoping to reach chamber temps of ~60C at least, 


Hotend: Phateus Rapido HF


Nevermore Carbon Filter to allow for printing of all materials safely. 


Above all, this should be fast. Very Fast. And relatively cheap and easy to make. And, it should be able to print some "engineering grade materials". Finally, fun is the #1 priority
